What do we want to run in the experiments?

1. We want to have a function with only one parameter
that needs to be modified.

2. We want the result to contain: 
    - The policy file that will be run in the validation 
    encounters.
    - The training metrics with: avg. rewards, loss.
    - Hyperparameters and reward structure for report.
